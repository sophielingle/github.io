        <p>Since 1930, vinyl records have been a reliable form of recording and playing music. 
            Almost 100 years later, people still love to collect and listen to their favorite music on vinyl records. 
            This is because of their long-lasting durabilty, sound quality, and potential extra content, such as posters or CDs.

        <p>In addition to providing the benefits of a higher sound quality and potential bonus items, people who appreciate collecting enjoy finding rare records or records related to their favorite artist. 
            This has only been encouraged by the creation of Record Store Day. 
            Record Store Day was created in 2007 to bring together thousands of independent record stores across the states to celebrate and sell special releases. 
            The next Record Store Day will be held on Saturday, April 12, 2025. </p>
